## Project Description

Matsya Arat is primarily designed for Fish Brokers (আড়তদার) to manage their buying and selling records. It is a fish buying and selling manager app that enables them to create "new sales" by adding information about the buyer and seller and keeping track of buyer credit payments. The app allows Fish Brokers to view the total sales of a particular seller and generate an invoice with payment adjustments. The project includes several useful features such as search filtering, date filtering, sorting data based on specific keys, creating and updating buyer and seller information, and making credit payments to adjust due amounts.
